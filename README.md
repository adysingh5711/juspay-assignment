   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adysingh5711/juspay-assignment.git
   cd juspay-assignment
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`


## Development

### Development Workflow

1. **Code Organization**: Follow the established module structure
2. **TypeScript**: Maintain strict type safety throughout
3. **Component Design**: Create reusable, composable components
4. **Performance**: Optimize for minimal re-renders and fast loading
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Code Quality Standards

- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting across the project
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled for maximum type safety
- **Component Documentation**: JSDoc comments for all public APIs


## Build and Deployment

### Production Build

```bash
# Create optimized production build
npm run build
```

The build process includes:
- TypeScript compilation
- Code minification and optimization
- Asset optimization and compression
- Source map generation (disabled for production)
- Bundle analysis and chunk optimization

npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

#### Netlify
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify

```

### Environment Configuration

The application supports multiple environments:

- **Development**: `npm run dev` - Hot reload and debugging
- **Production**: `npm run build` - Optimized for performance
- **Preview**: `npm run preview` - Local production testing

## Design Decisions

### Architecture Choices

**React Router v6**: Selected for its modern API, better TypeScript support, and improved performance over v5. The nested routing structure provides better code organization and shared layout components.

**Context API over Redux**: Chose React Context for state management due to the application's moderate complexity. This reduces bundle size while maintaining excellent developer experience and performance.

**Tailwind CSS**: Implemented for rapid development and consistent design system. The utility-first approach ensures maintainable styles and responsive design.

**Framer Motion**: Selected for production-ready animations with excellent performance. Provides smooth microinteractions without impacting bundle size significantly.

### UX/UI Design Decisions

**Enhanced Navigation Structure**: Took the liberty to add an "Orders" section in the Left Sidebar under Dashboard to provide better user experience and logical navigation flow. This addition allows users to quickly access order management functionality directly from the main navigation.

**Dynamic Right Sidebar Sections**: Implemented an animated section reordering system for the right sidebar. When users click on "Activities" or "Notifications", the selected section smoothly animates to the top, providing an intuitive and engaging user experience while maintaining visual hierarchy.

**Consistent Navigation Patterns**: Added a "Recently" option in the left sidebar to maintain consistency across the navigation structure, ensuring users have quick access to recently viewed items and maintaining a cohesive design language.

**Focused Page Implementation**: While the Figma design included 5 pages at the bottom, strategically implemented only two pages to demonstrate full functionality without redundant data. This approach showcases the complete feature set while maintaining clean, purposeful content.

## Challenges Faced

**SubList Icon Spacing Complexity**: Setting up the subList in the left sidebar presented significant challenges. The Figma design showed spacing for sub-items but no actual icons, while main headings required icons. Initial attempts using padding proved inadequate for responsive design. The solution involved implementing an empty <div className="size-4"></div> container for subList items that maintains the same space allocation as the icon container in main items, providing better responsive behavior and visual consistency.

**Data Integrity in Sorting**: The original Figma design contained repeated IDs after every 5 items, which caused sorting functionality to break by grouping identical IDs together. This required a workaround by modifying the data structure to ensure unique identifiers while maintaining the visual design integrity and sorting performance.

**Responsive Icon Management**: Balancing icon visibility and spacing across different screen sizes required careful consideration of container sizing, ensuring that both icon and non-icon states maintain proper alignment and visual hierarchy.

## Improvements Made

### Enhanced User Experience

**Navigation Enhancement**: Added a dedicated button in the left sidebar to navigate to the second page of the assignment, providing clear user flow and easy access to the order management functionality.

**Integrated Dashboard Cards**: Mapped the navigation button to the orders card in the main layout, creating a seamless connection between the dashboard overview and detailed order management interface.

**Improved Accessibility**: Enhanced keyboard navigation and screen reader support throughout the application, ensuring the interface is accessible to all users.

**Performance Optimization**: Implemented efficient state management and component memoization to ensure smooth interactions and fast rendering across all device types.

### Performance Optimizations

**Code Splitting**: Implemented route-based code splitting to reduce initial bundle size. Each major feature loads independently, improving Time to Interactive.

**Lazy Loading**: Components load on-demand using React.lazy() and Suspense, reducing initial JavaScript payload.

**Memoization**: Strategic use of useMemo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders in data-intensive components.

**Bundle Optimization**: Custom Vite configuration with manual chunk splitting for optimal caching and loading performance.

### Responsive Design Strategy

**Mobile-First Approach**: All components designed for mobile devices first, then enhanced for larger screens.

**Breakpoint System**: Consistent breakpoints using Tailwind's responsive utilities:
- Mobile: `< 640px`
- Tablet: `640px - 1024px`
- Desktop: `> 1024px`

**Grid Layout**: CSS Grid for complex layouts, Flexbox for component alignment and spacing.

## Performance Optimizations

### Bundle Size Optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based and component-based splitting
- **Tree Shaking**: Eliminated unused code from dependencies
- **Asset Optimization**: Compressed images and optimized SVGs
- **Vendor Chunking**: Separate vendor bundles for better caching

### Runtime Performance
- **Memoization**: Prevented unnecessary re-renders with React.memo
- **Efficient Filtering**: Optimized search and filter algorithms
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large data sets (implemented in table components)
- **Debounced Search**: Reduced API calls and improved user experience

### Loading Performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load on-demand
- **Preloading**: Critical resources preloaded for faster initial render
- **Caching Strategy**: Optimized cache headers for static assets

## Accessibility

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

**Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactive elements
**Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
**Color Contrast**: Meets WCAG AA contrast requirements
**Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators and logical tab order

### Implementation Details

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of headings, landmarks, and form elements
